This project was originally created with CCS v4.2 and it is stored in github:

https://github.com/claudiuo/msp430f2274.git

The repository doesn't store project specific files so it may work in CCS 5 also.

What I want to do:
- build on the existing code in the timerA project
- added serial communication so I can see values in terminal
- add ADC to use with the accelerometer - at this time, I am just reading the internal temperature sensor
